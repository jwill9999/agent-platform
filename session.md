### Session-close guardrail (required)

- Local-only changes are not complete.
- Before ending a task/session, ensure work is committed and pushed to `origin`.
- Verify the remote branch/ref exists (for example `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` or `git status -sb` showing `origin/<branch>` tracking).
- `--no-verify` is high-risk: it skips Husky/local checks. If used, you must run the skipped build/typecheck/test checks manually and confirm they pass before closing work.

## What happened (this session)

### Workspace file UI/API

Branch state: `task/agent-platform-ws.4` contains the `agent-platform-ws.4` implementation.

- Added shared workspace file contracts for managed areas, file rows, area listings, and list responses.
- Added `GET /v1/workspace/files` to list `uploads`, `generated`, `scratch`, and `exports` with workspace-relative paths only.
- Added `GET /v1/workspace/files/download?path=...` to stream safe workspace files as attachments.
- Enforced PathJail validation for listing and downloads, including traversal, absolute path, directory, and symlink escape denial.
- Added the Settings > Workspace UI with area summary cards, a file table, refresh/error states, and download actions.
- Added workspace file formatting helpers and focused web tests.
- Updated the API reference and task spec sign-off for the workspace file endpoints.

Quality gates passed:

- `pnpm format:check`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/contracts run build`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/contracts run test`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/api run typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/api run lint`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/api run test` (run with escalation because API Supertest binds local ports)
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/web run typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/web run lint`
- `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/web run test -- test/workspace-files.test.ts`
- Focused API check: `pnpm --filter @agent-platform/api exec vitest run test/workspaceRouter.test.ts`

## Current state

### Git

- **Current branch:** `task/agent-platform-ws.4`
- **Latest task commit:** branch HEAD (`Expose workspace files in UI and API`)
- **Feature branch:** `feature/agent-platform-workspace-storage`
- **Next task in chain:** `agent-platform-ws.6`

### Beads

- `agent-platform-ws.4` is closed locally in Beads; Dolt auto-push failed due unavailable GitHub SSH/network auth from this environment.
- `agent-platform-ws.6` is next in the chain.

### Quality

- Affected package typecheck/lint/test and repo format check passed in this session.

---

## Next (priority order)

1. Commit and push `task/agent-platform-ws.4` to `origin`.
2. Sync/push Beads Dolt state from an environment with GitHub SSH/network access.
3. Continue the chain with `agent-platform-ws.6` from `task/agent-platform-ws.4`.

## UI/UX Ticket Specifications (manual beads reference)

### 1. Display a thinking block with model logic before streaming the answer -completed

**Requirements:**

- When a user sends a message, a "thinking" block should appear in the chat UI before the agent's answer begins streaming.
- The "thinking" block must clearly indicate the agent/model is processing, using a visual distinct from the final answer.
- The block should disappear as soon as the agent's answer starts streaming.
- The implementation must not block or delay the streaming of the actual answer.
- The design should be consistent with the rest of the chat UI (bright, clean, minimalistic).
  **Definition of Done:**
- Thinking block appears before agent response and disappears on stream start.
- Playwright test covers this interaction.
- SonarQube/Problems show no new issues in touched files.

### 2. Refactor sidebar: only show Chat/IDE, move other items to Settings, remove Sessions/Tools

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-ucg`

### 3. Remove sessions sidebar, move sessions under menu as collapsible agent dropdowns

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-7d1`

### 4. Update chat UI: show only feedback block for agent responses, remove agent bubble, keep user bubble

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-de4`

### 5. Refactor input bar controls into unified chat input

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-lt6`
