### Session-close guardrail (required)

- Local-only changes are not complete.
- Before ending a task/session, ensure work is committed and pushed to `origin`.
- Verify the remote branch/ref exists (for example `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>` or `git status -sb` showing `origin/<branch>` tracking).
- `--no-verify` is high-risk: it skips Husky/local checks. If used, you must run the skipped build/typecheck/test checks manually and confirm they pass before closing work.

## What happened (this session)

### Coding tool contracts documented

Branch state: `task/agent-platform-code-tools.2` contains the completed second task in the structured coding tool pack chain.

- Added `docs/coding-tool-contracts.md` as the implementation reference for structured edit, read-only git, governed test runner, repository map, and code search tools.
- Defined stable tool names, tool kinds, risk tiers, approval policy, shared `CodingEvidenceSchema`, artifact schema, result envelope, error codes, audit event mapping, and truncation/artifact storage rules.
- Documented critic and Definition-of-Done evidence consumption rules, including the future `DodContractSchema.structuredEvidence` extension.
- Linked the contract reference from `docs/coding-runtime.md` and `docs/tasks/agent-platform-code-tools.2.md`.
- Closed `agent-platform-code-tools.2` locally in Beads. Beads Dolt auto-push failed because GitHub DNS/network access was unavailable in the sandbox.

Quality gates passed:

- `pnpm docs:lint`

## Current state

### Git

- **Current branch:** `task/agent-platform-code-tools.2`
- **Current commit:** `28c842d` before the `session.md` amend
- **Latest completed task:** `agent-platform-code-tools.2`
- **Next task in chain:** `agent-platform-code-tools.3` from the task-2 tip
- **Remote sync:** pending; network/DNS blocked GitHub access during this session

### Beads

- `agent-platform-code-tools.2` is closed locally.
- `agent-platform-code-tools.3` is the next downstream task.
- Beads Dolt remote push still needs to run when network access is available.

### Quality

- Documentation lint and relative-link checks passed.
- No code files changed, so SonarQube/Problems/code quality gate was not required.

---

## Next (priority order)

1. Re-run `bd dolt push` once GitHub network/DNS access is available.
2. Push `task/agent-platform-code-tools.2` to `origin`.
3. Start `agent-platform-code-tools.3` from the task-2 tip and implement the structured edit/apply patch tool against `docs/coding-tool-contracts.md`.

## UI/UX Ticket Specifications (manual beads reference)

### 1. Display a thinking block with model logic before streaming the answer -completed

**Requirements:**

- When a user sends a message, a "thinking" block should appear in the chat UI before the agent's answer begins streaming.
- The "thinking" block must clearly indicate the agent/model is processing, using a visual distinct from the final answer.
- The block should disappear as soon as the agent's answer starts streaming.
- The implementation must not block or delay the streaming of the actual answer.
- The design should be consistent with the rest of the chat UI (bright, clean, minimalistic).
  **Definition of Done:**
- Thinking block appears before agent response and disappears on stream start.
- Playwright test covers this interaction.
- SonarQube/Problems show no new issues in touched files.

### 2. Refactor sidebar: only show Chat/IDE, move other items to Settings, remove Sessions/Tools

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-ucg`

### 3. Remove sessions sidebar, move sessions under menu as collapsible agent dropdowns

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-7d1`

### 4. Update chat UI: show only feedback block for agent responses, remove agent bubble, keep user bubble

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-de4`

### 5. Refactor input bar controls into unified chat input

Tracked in Beads: `agent-platform-lt6`
